## PerceptualAudioCodingIntroduction

* What is Codec?

The process of sound propagation from sound source to ear could be described as: Signal soundwave(analog)->A/D conversion->Digital encoding->Digital decoding->D/A conversion->Signal soundwave(analog); And the codec consists of encoder&decoder.

* Perceptual Coder methods

1.Redundancy removal: Model signal statistics
2.Irrelevancyremoval: Model signal perception
3.Entropycoding: Model probability distribution of quantized elements
